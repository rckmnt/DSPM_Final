In this exercise, you will apply many of the concepts you have learnt in this course to analyze two competing popular soda brands, Coca-Cola and Pepsi. You will be asked to perform a sentiment analysis of the two brands. You will also be asked to parse sentences into parts of speech and extract the Top 100 nouns, verbs, adjectives (of all types) and hashtags by occurrence. In addition to the specific outputs, you will also be asked to answer and summarize with data the following questions:

1. Which brand has more positive sentiment (and by how much: quantify)?

2. What attributes of the product are the reasons why the perception is more positive? (Hint: use specific Parts of Speech)

3. What attributes of each product are the top contributors for their negative perception? (Hint: use specific Parts of Speech)

Recommended steps


    Tokenize: using sent_tokenize, word_tokenize and TweetTokenizer

    Extract and count sentences that include one of the matching Brands: Coca-Cola or Pepsi

    Perform a sentiment analysis on both Products and print out the overall relative sentiment: using  SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

    Extract all words in sentences by Brand

    Remove stop words

    For each Brand, create lists for the main parts of speech and print Top n words and hashtags in each list using the Part Of Speech (POS) tagger: upenn_tagset

    Create any visualizations you feel would be useful in communicating your findings

    Summarize recommendations for Coke or Pepsi based on your findings
